There was once a naughty boy who used to play tricks on his family.
One day he went out with the sheep and then shouted that a wolf came and attacked him so everyone came and found out he was joking.
He did this 2 more times and they got fooled again.
But one day when he was out with the sheep a actual wolf came and he shouted for help, but because of what he did nobody came to help him and that is how he dies.

The Moral of this story is to not lie when it is a serious topic or else after a few times they will not take you seriously.
